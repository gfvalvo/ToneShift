/* Modulated delay line

   Inspired by;
   http://musicdsp.org/showArchiveComment.php?ArchiveID=154

   But details changed for Teensy Audio.
   No feedback within the class, just done externally
   so we can add filters and stuff to the loop.

   Delay time is a signal input to the block, and functions from 0 to 0x7fff,
   scaling the delay time accordingly.
